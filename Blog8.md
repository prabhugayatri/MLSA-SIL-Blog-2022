In the previous [blog](https://github.com/prabhugayatri/MLSA-SIL-Blog-2022/blob/main/Blog7.md), we became familiar with Azure Data Explorer connector in Power BI. This blog will guide you on how create a report and visualize the data using Power BI. Let's get started!

## What is Power BI Report

A Power BI report is a multi-perspective view into a dataset, with visuals that represent different findings and insights from that dataset. A report can have a single visual or pages full of visuals.

## Advantages of Power BI Report 

* Power BI bases a report on a single dataset.
* Report designers create the visuals in a report to represent nuggets of information.
* The visuals aren't static. They update as the underlying data changes. You can interact with the visuals and filters as you dig into the data to discover insights and look for answers. Like a dashboard, but more so, a report is highly interactive and highly customizable. 
* The extent of what you can do with a report will depend on the role and permissions assigned by the report designer.

## Create quick reports in the Power BI service

There are several ways to create reports quickly in the Power BI service. Instead of downloading the Power BI Desktop app and importing the data, you can paste data straight into Power BI on the web, and Power BI automatically generates visuals for you.

## Create a quick report
In the navigation pane in the Power BI service, you can select the Create button that opens a page where you can select your data source. It's also accessible from the New report button on Home.

Currently, we only support creating a report based on an existing dataset, or pasting or manually entering data directly in a table. Over time you'll see other sources, such as uploading an Excel file.

When you choose to paste or manually enter data, you get a grid that you can start to type into. You can also paste data by using Ctrl + V or the context menu.

You can use the context menu to add and remove columns. If your pasted data includes a header row, select Use first row as headers to automatically promote the first row to the header row. Power BI automatically detects the data types, but you have the option to set them manually. Select the Data type button next to the column name.

 As you go through the creation process, Power BI creates a new dataset for you, and autogenerates a summarized view of your data. These autogenerated visuals propel you from raw data to insights faster than ever.

Changing the data you see in the report is easy, too. Use the Your data pane to add or remove fields from the report. Select and deselect fields to update what you want to measure and analyze. Power BI automatically plots meaningful charts based on your field selection. Read Interact with autogenerated "quick" reports to see all the ways you explore and modify these reports.
