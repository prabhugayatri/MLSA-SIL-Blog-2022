In the previous [blog](https://github.com/prabhugayatri/MLSA-SIL-Blog-2022/blob/main/Blog7.md), we became familiar with Azure Data Explorer connector in Power BI. This blog will guide you on how create a report and visualize the data using Power BI. Let's get started!

## What is Power BI Report

A Power BI report is a multi-perspective view into a dataset, with visuals that represent different findings and insights from that dataset. A report can have a single visual or pages full of visuals.

## Advantages of Power BI Report 

1.Power BI bases a report on a single dataset.
2.Report designers create the visuals in a report to represent nuggets of information.
3.The visuals aren't static. They update as the underlying data changes. You can interact with the visuals and filters as you dig into the data to discover insights and look for answers. Like a dashboard, but more so, a report is highly interactive and highly customizable. 
4.The extent of what you can do with a report will depend on the role and permissions assigned by the report designer.

## Create quick reports in the Power BI service

There are several ways to create reports quickly in the Power BI service. Instead of downloading the Power BI Desktop app and importing the data, you can paste data straight into Power BI on the web, and Power BI automatically generates visuals for you.
