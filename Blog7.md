In the previous [blog](https://github.com/prabhugayatri/MLSA-SIL-Blog-2022/blob/main/Blog6.md), we became familiar with Power BI. This blog will guide you on how to use the Azure Data Explorer connector in Power BI. Let's get started!

## Brief
Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. Power BI is a unified, scalable platform for self-service and enterprise business intelligence (BI). One can process, analyse the data and gain insights from it. Using the connector, you can visualize any data, and seamlessly infuse the visuals into the apps you use every day. 
Azure Data Explorer provides three options for connecting to data in Power BI: 
* Use the built-in connector 
* Import a query from Azure Data Explorer
* Use a SQL query

## Prerequisites
An account that is a member of [Azure Active Directory](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/samples) and [Power BI Desktop] that you can download for free.

## How to use the Azure Data Explorer connector in Power BI?
** Step 1:** Connect to the Azure Data Explorer help cluster, then you bring in a subset of your data.
** Step 2:** In the Power BI Desktop, on the **Home tab**, select **Get Data** then **More**.
** Step 3:** Search for Azure Data Explorer, select ** Azure Data Explorer** then **Connect**.
** Step 4:** On the Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) screen, fill out the form with the following information.

** Step 5:** If you don't already have a connection to the help cluster, sign in. Sign in with an organizational account, then select **Connect**.
** Step 6:** On the Navigator screen, select your database then **Transform Data**.
** Step 6:** The table opens in Power Query Editor, where you can edit rows and columns before importing the data.
