In the previous [blog](https://github.com/prabhugayatri/MLSA-SIL-Blog-2022/blob/main/Blog5.md), we learnt about data Visualization using Azure Data Explorer dashboards. This blog will introduce about [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/). Let's get started!

## What is Power BI?
Power BI is a unified, scalable platform for self-service and enterprise business intelligence (BI). Connect to and visualize any data, and seamlessly infuse the visuals into the apps you use every day.
It is an interactive data visualization software product developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on business intelligence. It is part of the Microsoft Power Platform. Power BI lets us easily connect to our data sources, clean, and model our data without affecting the underlying source, visualize what is important, and share that with anyone we want.

## What are the parts of Power BI?
Power BI consists of a Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps that are available on any device, with native mobile BI apps for Windows, iOS, and Android.

## What are the advantages of Power BI?
* **Turns insighhts in action:** Power BI helps us to make informed, confident business decisions by putting data-driven insights into everyoneâ€™s hands.
* **Gives access to real-time information:** In Power BI dashboards get updated in real-time. With Power BI, one can set up automatic data refresh to have the dashboard reflect data in real time. This gives users the ability to identify opportunities, handle time-sensitive data, and find solutions for problems quickly and effectively.
* **Possesses Artificial Intelligence capabilities:** Power BI is that it possesses Artificial Intelligence capabilities that allow users to get more value out of their data and reporting.
* **Power BI is secure:** Power BI has a number of security features that enable users to protect sensitive information and meet various security and compliance standards.
* **Connects with multiple data sources:** Power BI is robust and can connect to large number of data sources, from file data sources like Excel and CSV to database sources.

## What are the building blocks of Power BI?
The task what we perform in Power BI can be divided into some building blocks
The basic building blocks of Power BI are:
* Visualizations
* Datasets
* Reports
* Dashboards
* Tiles

## What is Visualization?
Visualization is a visual representation of data in the form of graphs, charts, color-coded maps. The goal of  is to pvisualization is to resent data in a way that provides context and insights, both of which would probably be difficult to discern from a raw table of numbers or text.

## What is Dataset?
A dataset is a collection of data that PowerBI uses to create visualizations. Power BI lets us connect to and import all sorts of datasets and bring all of it together in one place. Datasets are associated with workspaces and a single dataset can be part of many workspaces.

## What is Report in Power BI?
Report is a collection of visualizations that appear together on one or more pages. Reports lets us to create many visualizations, on multiple pages if necessary, and let us arrange those visualizations in whatever way best tells our story.

## What are Dashboards?
A dashboard is a collection of visuals that one can share with others. When one is ready to share a report, or a collection of visualizations, one can create a dashboard. A dashboard must fit on a single page, also called a canvas.

## What is tiles?
Tile is a single visualization on a dashboard. It's the rectangular box that holds an individual visual. Tile can also referred to the snapshot of the data pinned to the dashboard. One can create tiles from dashboard, report, excel etc.
